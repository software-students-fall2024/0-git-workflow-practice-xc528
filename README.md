# My Link

A link I found interesting was [This](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

When first starting this assignment, I did not know how to clone a repository, so I searched online for instructions and I found this git website. It is always useful to look things up on the GitHub website or website of any official website of a platform/software to trouble shoot. Reading carefully about the instructions would help you to better understand the concepts and learn what to do.

## Comment
Comment from Hanna Han: When we want to learn a new technology, reading the documentation is the most important and necessary step because it provides the most comprehensive and accurate information and details about that technology.
